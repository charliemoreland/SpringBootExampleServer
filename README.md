# SpringBootExampleServer
This is two seperate spring boot servers that you can run. They were modified by me built off of tutorials provided from a class I took at Iowa State. 
 They are all based around a document repository project I am working on this fall semester 2022.
 The server is hosted on localhost:8080/ and there are several commands you can run from there. 
The DocumentManager has several different features of returning a list of current documents. Searching for Documents Using docID, deleting documents, and creating new
documents by sending a json file to the server. 
The Document Database server interacts with a MySql server and is able to create dummy data for testing purposes as well as has all of the same functionality as the Document Manager Server.
